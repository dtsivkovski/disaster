    <h1> Earthquakes </h1>
    <p> What to do during an earthquake</p>
    <p>1) Drop down on to the ground </p>
    <p>2) Crawl on your hand and knees to a sturdy structure like a desk or bed and hide under it making sure to cover your head neck </p>
    <p>3) Hold on to the sturdy structure </p>
    <p>4) Wait, most earthquakes only last 10-30 seconds</p>
      <p> </p>
    <p> Earthquakes are the shaking of the earth's surface caused by a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves </p>
    <p> The lithosphere is the layer of earth comprised of the crust and the uppermost part of the mantle</p>
    <p> Other name for earthquakes</p>
    <p> Quake: The general name for this phenomenon as quakes on moon are referred to as moonquakes and on mars they are marsquakes so on earth its earthquakes</p>
    <p> Tremor: The word tremor may also be used for non-earthquake seismic rumbles</p>
    <p> Tremblor</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> The intensity and magnitude of an earthquake varies from those that canâ€™t be felt to those strong enough to propel people or objects into the air and cause major destruction</p>
    <p> Intensity would measure the amount of shaking caused by an earthquake</p>
    <p> Magnitude scales are used to measure size of earthquakes</p>
    <p> Scales vary from country to country</p>
    <p> Japan has their own magnitude scale for instance that ranges from 0 to 7</p>
    <p> The USGS uses the moment magnitude scale as the Richter scale is now considered outdated.</p>
    <p> The Richter scale ranges from 2.0 to 9.0 and measures the height of a seismic wave</p>
    <p> The moment magnitude scale ranges from -2.0 to 9.9 and measures the total energy released by the earthquake</p>
    <p> The two scales have similar magnitudes from 3.0 to 7.0</p>
    <p> The largest earthquakes that has been measured on a seismograph was 9.5 known as the 1960 Chilean earthquake on May 22,1960</p>
    <p> The 1556 Shaanxi Earthquake has the most fatalities at over 830,000 fatalities</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> Earthquakes can be naturally caused or artificially caused</p>
    <p> Artificially caused earthquakes occur due to mining, fracking, and nuclear tests</p>
    <p> Natural earthquakes are primarily caused by geological faults, landslides, volcanic activity, and other seismic events</p>
    <p> Only 10% of an earthquakes total energy is radiated as seismic energy, the rest may power fracture growth or be converted into heat through friction which may increase the global heat levels of earth</p>
