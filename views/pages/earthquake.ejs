      <h2> What to do during an earthquake</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Drop down on to the ground </li>
        <li>Crawl on your hand and knees to a sturdy structure like a desk or bed and hide under it making sure to cover your head neck </li>
        <li>Hold on to the sturdy structure </li>
        <li>Wait, as most earthquakes only last 10-30 seconds</li>
      </ol>
      <h2> General Information</h2>
        <li> Earthquakes are the shaking of the earth's surface caused by a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves </li>
        <li> The lithosphere is the layer of earth comprised of the crust and the uppermost part of the mantle</li>
        <li> Other name for earthquakes</li>
          <li> Quake: The general name for this phenomenon as quakes on moon are referred to as moonquakes and on mars they are marsquakes so on earth its earthquakes</li>
          <li> Tremor: The word tremor may also be used for non-earthquake seismic rumbles</li>
          <li> Tremblor: Earth tremor</li>
        <li> The largest earthquakes that has been measured on a seismograph was 9.5 known as the 1960 Chilean earthquake on May 22,1960</li>
        <li> The 1556 Shaanxi Earthquake has the most fatalities at over 830,000 fatalities</li>
      <h2>How Earthquakes are measured </h2>
        <li> The intensity and magnitude of an earthquake varies from those that canâ€™t be felt to those strong enough to propel people or objects into the air and cause major destruction</li>
        <li> Intensity would measure the amount of shaking caused by an earthquake</li>
        <li> Magnitude scales are used to measure size of earthquakes</li>
        <li> Scales vary from country to country</li>
        <li> Japan has their own magnitude scale for instance that ranges from 0 to 7</li>
        <li> The USGS uses the moment magnitude scale as the Richter scale is now considered outdated.</li>
          <li> The Richter scale ranges from 2.0 to 9.0 and measures the height of a seismic wave</li>
          <li> The moment magnitude scale ranges from -2.0 to 9.9 and measures the total energy released by the earthquake</li>
          <li> The two scales have similar magnitudes from 3.0 to 7.0</li>
        <li> The USGS website has a live tracker of all earthquakes </li>
        <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/?extent=-80.53207,-364.92188&extent=84.16085,119.88281" class="button"> Live Tracker</a>
      <h2> What Causes Earthquakes</h2>
        <li> Earthquakes can be naturally caused or artificially caused</li>
        <li> Artificially caused earthquakes occur due to mining, fracking, and nuclear tests</li>
        <li> Natural earthquakes are primarily caused by geological faults, landslides, volcanic activity, and other seismic events</li>
        <li> Only 10% of an earthquakes total energy is radiated as seismic energy, the rest may power fracture growth or be converted into heat through friction which may increase the global heat levels of earth</li>
