      <h2> What to do during a Tsunami</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Get to as a high as ground as possible</li>
        <li>Tsunamis can come as a series of waves so wait there till you recieve word that it is safe to leave</li>

      <h2> How to tell if a tsunami is happening</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are at the beach you will see the tides recede greatly</li>
        <li>If you do see a large recede in tides then there is probably around 5 minutes till the tsunami reaches</li>
      <h2> Warning System</h2>
        <li> he Pacific Tsunami Warning System, a coalition of 26 nations headquartered in Hawaii, maintains a web of seismic equipment and water level gauges to identify tsunamis at sea </li>
        <li> Similar systems are proposed to protect coastal areas worldwide</li>
        
      <h2> General Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Tsunamis are a series of ocean waves that sends surges of water, sometimes reaching heights of over 100 feet (30.5 meters), onto land </li>
        <li> About 80 % of tsunamis happen within the Pacific Ocean’s “Ring of Fire,” a geologically active area where tectonic shifts make volcanoes and earthquakes common</li>
        <li> Tsunamis race across the sea at up to 500 miles (805 kilometers) an hour. At that pace, they can cross the entire expanse of the Pacific Ocean in less than a day and their long wavelengths mean they lose very little energy along the way </li>
        <li> In the deep ocean, tsunami waves may appear only a foot or so high. But as they approach shoreline and enter shallow water they slow down and begin to grow in energy and height </li>
        <li> The tops of the waves move faster than their bottoms do, which causes them to rise precipitously </li>
        <li> A tsunami’s trough, the low point beneath the wave’s crest, often reaches shore first. When it does, it produces a vacuum effect that sucks coastal water seaward and exposes harbor and sea floors</li>
      <h2> What Causes Tsunamis</h2>
        <li>Tsunamis are typically caused by large, undersea earthquakes at tectonic plate boundaries. When the ocean floor at a plate boundary rises or falls suddenly, it displaces the water above it and launches the rolling waves that will become a tsunami</li>
        <li> Tsunamis may also be caused by underwater landslides, volcanic eruptions, or by the impact of a large meteorite plunging into an ocean</li>
      <h2> Appearance of Tsunamis</h2>
        <li> A tsunami is usually composed of a series of waves, called a wave train, so its destructive force may be compounded as successive waves reach shore </li>
        <li> Some tsunamis do not appear on shore as massive breaking waves but instead resemble a quickly surging tide that flood coastal areas </li>
