    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Wildfires typically start small and are typically caused by lightning that engulfs everything in its path in flames. As people start to expand the regions in which they build homes, they are becoming more frequent throughout the years. It is very important, especially in areas where wildfires are common, to prepare ahead of time.</p>
